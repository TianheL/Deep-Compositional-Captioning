# Deep Compositional Captioning
A pytorch reproduction of "Deep Compositional Captioning: Describing Novel Object Categories without Paired Training Data". 

Origin Paper: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05284>.
You can find the code of the author here <https://github.com/LisaAnne/DCC>. 
But it is implemented in caffe.

This is also the third project of NNDL course, which requires us to implement a novel image captioner on MSCOCO.

We just implement direct transfer since it is better than delta transfer according to the origin paper.
